Subject: Dissertation committee scheduling nightmare

Hi Professor Williams,

I'm trying to coordinate my proposal defense and it's turning into a logistics puzzle. Here's where we're at:

Dr. Smith can only do afternoons after the 20th. Dr. Johnson is out of town until the 18th. You mentioned you have a conference from the 22nd-24th.

Could you please send me your complete availability for the last two weeks of the month? I need to submit the room booking by this Friday at the latest.

Also, I still need you to review Chapter 3 of my proposal. I know you're swamped, but if you could provide feedback by the 19th, that would give me time to make revisions before the defense.

One more thing - the graduate school requires a signed form from you confirming you've approved the proposal for defense. The form is attached. This needs to be submitted at least 10 days before the defense date.

Thank you for your patience with all of this!

Best regards,
Jennifer
