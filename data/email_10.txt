Subject: Conference travel logistics

Hi attendees,

Lots of details to cover for the upcoming conference:

1. Hotel bookings - please book by tomorrow to get the group rate. Use code "TECH2024"

2. @John - you're presenting on Day 2 at 3 PM. Please send me your final slides by Monday so I can compile them.

3. @Maria - can you create a shared document with everyone's flight info? Would help for coordinating airport rides.

4. Receipts - KEEP EVERYTHING. Submit expense reports within 1 week after we return. Finance is being strict about this.

5. Team dinner is confirmed for Tuesday night at 7 PM at The Blue Door restaurant

If you haven't registered for the conference yet, do it NOW. Early bird pricing ends tonight at midnight.

See you all soon!
Coordinator Chen
