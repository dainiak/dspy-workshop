Subject: REMINDER: Grant proposal deadlines approaching!!

Research team,

This is your friendly (but stressed) reminder that we have multiple deadlines coming up:

1. NSF proposal - Due April 30th at 5 PM EST (NO EXTENSIONS)
   - @Karen: Need your budget justification ASAP
   - @Michael: Still waiting on your preliminary results section

2. NIH grant - Due May 15th
   - @Susan: Please review the entire document by May 1st
   - @Everyone: Biosketches need to be updated in the new format

3. Internal seed funding - Due May 10th
   - This is lower priority but would be nice to have

I cannot stress enough how important the NSF deadline is. If we miss it, we have to wait another year. Karen and Michael - I need your sections by end of day Wednesday at the absolute latest.

Please confirm you've received this email.
