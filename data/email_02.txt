Subject: RE: Internship fair prep

Hi everyone,

Just a heads up that the career center moved our booth assignment to Hall B instead of Hall A. Not a big deal but wanted everyone to know.

@Jessica - can you print 50 more copies of our flyers? We ran out last time. Would be great to have them by Tuesday morning.

@Marcus - the banner design looks good, just need you to fix the typo in "Enginering" :) No rush on this, just whenever you get a chance before Thursday.

I'll be bringing the tablecloth and candy. If anyone wants to help with setup, I'll be there at 8 AM on Friday. Totally optional though!

Best,
Samantha

P.S. Don't forget to wear business casual!
