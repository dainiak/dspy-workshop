Subject: Few updates from student council

Hey y'all!

Great meeting yesterday! Just wanted to send a quick recap since I know some people had to leave early.

The budget for the spring festival got approved ðŸŽ‰ We have $5000 to work with. Emma, since you're treasurer, can you set up the spreadsheet for tracking expenses? No huge rush but would be nice to have by next meeting.

Also, we decided to move forward with the mental health awareness week. If anyone wants to volunteer to lead this initiative, let me know by Friday!

Oh and Jake - you mentioned you had contacts at the local pizza place for sponsorship? Could you reach out to them this week?

Looking forward to seeing everyone at the next meeting on the 15th!

Cheers,
Maya
