Subject: FYI - Lab equipment maintenance

Hi all,

Just letting everyone know that the centrifuge in Lab 302 is acting up again. I've put in a maintenance request but they said it could take up to 2 weeks.

In the meantime, please use the one in Lab 305. I know it's inconvenient but we don't have much choice.

BTW, whoever has been leaving samples in the -80 freezer without labels, please stop. It's a safety violation and we could get dinged on our next inspection.

No action needed from anyone, just wanted to keep everyone informed.
