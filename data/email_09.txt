Subject: Re: Re: Re: Website redesign

Hi Dev Team,

Sorry for the long email chain. Let me summarize where we are:

The client finally approved the mockups (yay!) but wants some "minor" changes:
- Make the logo 20% bigger
- Change the blue to "more blue" (I know, I know...)
- Add a popup for newsletter signup (ugh)

@Ashley - can you handle the logo resize and color adjustment? Should be quick.

@Brian - I hate to ask, but can you implement the popup? I know we said no more popups but the client is insisting. Try to make it as non-intrusive as possible. Maybe a 5-second delay?

We need to show them a working version by next Friday's meeting. Not the final version, just something clickable.

Also, unrelated - who's organizing the team lunch next week? If no one's claimed it, I'm happy to coordinate.

Thanks team!
-PM Sandra
