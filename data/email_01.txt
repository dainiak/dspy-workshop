Subject: Quick sync on the ML project

Hey Sarah,

Hope you're doing well! I wanted to touch base about a few things from yesterday's meeting. First off, can you please review the dataset preprocessing code by Thursday? I noticed some potential issues with the normalization step that might affect our results.

Also, Mark mentioned he needs the feature engineering documentation - could you coordinate with him on that? It's not super urgent but would be good to have by early next week.

BTW, I'm scheduling our next team standup for Friday at 2 PM. Let me know if that doesn't work.

Oh, almost forgot - we need to submit the progress report to Prof. Chen by Monday EOD. This is CRITICAL since it counts for 20% of our grade. I can handle the results section if you can write up the methodology.

Thanks!
Alex
