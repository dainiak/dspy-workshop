Subject: Project handover notes

Hi Rachel,

As discussed, I'm transitioning off the mobile app project next week. Here's what needs attention:

The iOS build is failing on the CI/CD pipeline - something about provisioning profiles. You'll need to coordinate with IT to get that fixed. It's been broken for 3 days now so probably should be addressed soon.

There are 3 open pull requests that need review. Nothing urgent, but would be good to clear them out within the next sprint.

Oh, and please remember to update the documentation wiki. I started it but never finished the API section. The client asked about this last week so they're expecting it "soon" (whatever that means lol).

Let's sync on Wednesday to go over any questions you have?

Good luck!
Tom
